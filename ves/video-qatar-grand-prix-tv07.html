Qatar Grand Prix LIVE: F1 latest as Max Verstappen awaits possible grid penalty from stewards
Follow all the action from the Qatar Grand Prix as Lewis Hamilton starts on pole ahead of Max Verstappen as the Formula One season approaches a thrilling climax.

In search of a record-breaking eighth world championship, Hamilton trails Verstappen by 14 points in the drivers’ standings with just three races remaining of the season. However, after his stunning victory in Brazil, where Hamilton came from tenth on the grid to take victory, the momentum is firmly with the Mercedes driver. He followed up that performance with a dominant display in qualifying on Saturday, finishing four-tenths quicker than his title rival to take pole.

Overtaking is expected to be tricky on the Losail circuit, with teams likely to take a one-stop strategy, meaning there will be more pressure than ever on the approach into turn one. Verstappen escaped punishment after appearing to run Hamilton off the track in Brazil and the Briton admitted there was still a lack of clarity over the incident. “It’s not clear, every driver except for Max was asking for clarity,” he said. “It’s still not clear what the limits of the track are, it’s clearly not the white line any more when overtaking, so we just go for it. We just ask for consistency so, if it’s the same as the last race, then it should be the same for all of us.” Follow all the latest updates below:

Max Verstappen’s overly aggressive defence against Lewis Hamilton at Interlagos last weekend, and the lack of punishment following a right to review hearing with the FIA in Qatar this week, has hugely increased the tension between the Mercedes and Red Bull teams and respective team bosses Toto Wolff and Christian Horner.

“We wanted to trigger a discussion around it because it will probably be a theme in the next few races,” Wolff said on the hearing itself. “We didn’t really think it would go any further. You fight for every single point, we don’t expect to gain anything to be honest, from the right of review, it is more about the principle and philosophy.” But Horner said, “(It is) Obviously the right decision as it would open Pandora’s Box.”

On his feeling about Wolff, Horner was emphatic: “There is no relationship. There is competition,” he said.
“We have worked hard to get into this position, this is the first time they have been challenged and it is interesting to see how people react when they are challenged – it is by far the most politically that we have been involved with in the sport. I don’t need to go to dinner with Toto, I don’t need to kiss his a**e or anything like that.”

Lewis Hamilton maintained the momentum from last week’s stunning win in Brazil to claim pole for the inaugural Qatar Grand Prix after a “really sweet” qualifying lap on Saturday.

Max Verstappen, who leads his Mercedes rival by 14 points with three races to go, is set to start alongside Hamilton on the front row. But the Dutchman will first have to pay a visit to the stewards for allegedly “not respecting double waved yellow flags”.

The time gap between the two leading cars will also give all at Red Bull a restless night – almost half a second, a clear sign Hamilton’s new engine fitted last weekend has injected fresh life into his quest for an unprecedented eighth world title.

His flying lap time of 1min 20.827 that clinched Qatar’s first ever pole position proved way beyond Verstappen, who was 0.455sec slower.

“That last lap was beautiful. It was a really sweet lap. This track is amazing to drive. Woo, it felt good!” he tweeted.

Hamilton’s teammate Valtteri Bottas posted the third quickest time under floodlights at the Losail circuit to fill the second row with Pierre Gasly for Alpha Tauri.

Mercedes were handed an unexpected potential advantage in their titanic title battle with Red Bull after Verstappen’s teammate Sergio Perez failed to make it to the Q3 top 10 shootout.

With the Mexican down in the sixth row on Sunday’s grid Red Bull’s tactics to upset Mercedes rest on a one-man band named Verstappen.

Perez was not wrong when he ventured: “It’s going to be a very tricky race.” This was Hamilton’s 102nd career pole but his first since Hungary almost four months ago.

The F1 drama continues to crank up as the season approaches its conclusion, with Hamilton taking his 102nd career F1 pole position in a dominant display in qualifying.

Title rival Max Verstappen secured second place in his Red Bull, but he has been summoned to an FIA stewards hearing for allegedly ignoring double waved yellow flags during his final Q3 lap. The incident occurred when Pierre Gasly’s front wing was damaged by the kerbs and caused his front-right tyre to puncture. 

If Verstappen is judged to be at fault he could face a five-place grid drop for the Qatar GP, going on previous penalties for similar offences, but provisionally remains set to start the race from the front row.

The FIA also introduced new rear wing technical checks after qualifying in Qatar amid growing tensions between Red Bull and Mercedes about legality suspicions over rear wings. 

Despite topping FP2 and FP3, Valtteri Bottas had to settle for third place in qualifying for Mercedes and has also been summoned to see the stewards over the yellow flag incident, with Gasly taking fourth place after his late puncture.

Fernando Alonso impressed in Q3 to take fifth place for Alpine ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris and Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz Jr, who will see the stewards Sunday morning over the Gasly yellow flag incident. Yuki Tsunoda (AlphaTauri), Esteban Ocon (Alpine) and Sebastian Vettel (Aston Martin) completed the top 10 as Red Bull’s Sergio Perez missed out in 11th place in Q2.

Charles Leclerc suffered a cracked chassis which was diagnosed as the cause for his drop in pace for Ferrari in qualifying, leaving him down in 13th place behind Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll.
